  		</audio>
	<p>This audio clip features an immersive sound South African showcasing the heartbeat of the land we walk on. 
		I chose this audio as way to blend heritage with culture! Biltong aint only about food but its about the heritage we all experience as a whole. 
		Grabbing a nice dry meaty snack to munch on when having a braai/ event or a party, especially on Heritage Day aka National Braai day.
	 	The audio represents the blend of Heritage with the soothing voice preaching the nature of Africa, Our Africa!
		It reflects tranquiliy, love and compassion that is found in the horizon light of South Africa.
		Which was the best choice to install in the website as Cooks Biltong enviroment offers that great feeling.</p>
